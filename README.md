# ServiceOrientedComputing
Here is a GitHub repository description for a service-oriented computing project using MERN Stack and RESTful API:

This repository contains a service-oriented computing project that implements a distributed system for managing products using MERN Stack and RESTful API.

The system consists of a number of microservices, each of which is responsible for a specific task, such as managing product data, processing payments, and generating reports. The microservices communicate with each other using a message queue.

The system is highly scalable and fault-tolerant. If one microservice fails, the other microservices can continue to operate. The system is also very flexible and can be easily extended to add new features or support new products.

The system is built using the following technologies:

    Frontend: React
    Backend: Node.js, Express
    Database: MongoDB
    API: RESTful API
